## Theme: Topic 1 - Heuristic Search Methods for One Player Solitaire Games
Our chosen Solitaire Game is Match the Tiles. 

### Checkpoint
#### 1. specification of the work to be performed (definition of the game)
Swipe (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles. You should place all colored tiles onto the designated spots with the same color. The moves are synchronized, thus you must use existing fixed tiles to create gaps between tiles and solve the puzzle.

MATCH TILES - SLIDING PUZZLE GAME FEATURES:
• Different levels of varying complexity.
• Normal (4x4), big (5x5) and bigger (6x6) board sizes.
• Undo moves support.
• No time limit.

#### 2. related work with references to works found in a bibliographic search (articles, web pages and/or source code)

#### 3. formulation of the problem as a search problem (state representation, initial state, objective test, operators (names, preconditions, effects and costs), heuristics/evaluation function)

#### 4. implementation work already carried out (programming language, development environment, data structures, file structure, among others).

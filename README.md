## Theme: Topic 1 - Heuristic Search Methods for One Player Solitaire Games
Our chosen Solitaire Game is 

### Checkpoint
#### 1. specification of the work to be performed (definition of the game)

#### 2. related work with references to works found in a bibliographic search (articles, web pages and/or source code)

#### 3. formulation of the problem as a search problem (state representation, initial state, objective test, operators (names, preconditions, effects and costs), heuristics/evaluation function)

#### 4. implementation work already carried out (programming language, development environment, data structures, file structure, among others).
